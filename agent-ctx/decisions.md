# NovaRouter — Decision Log (why things are this way)

Intent-preservation memory. If a change would contradict an entry here, check
with the user before overriding, or add a new dated entry explaining the pivot.

## Platform pivots

- **2026-09 · Python port (current).** The whole app is FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX.
  The previous TypeScript implementation (and an intermediate Next.js 16 rebuild
  documented in `worklog.md` / `agent-ctx/api-contract.md`) is history — kept
  only as the API-shape reference. Reason: single runtime, no Node build step,
  one process serving UI + API.
- **UI = self-BFF, server-rendered.** `ui/` calls its own process's JSON API
  over HTTP instead of querying the DB directly. Reason: UI behaviour can never
  drift from gateway behaviour; tab modules stay thin; fragments (not JSON)
  drive HTMX updates.
- **Gateway parity with the TS original** (pipeline stages, spoofing, `_nova`
  metadata, RequestLog) was an explicit porting requirement — treat divergences
  as bugs, not improvements.

## Tricky tradeoffs worth remembering

- **Simulated sandbox executor** (`terminal/sandbox.py`): no child processes by
  design; outputs are synthesized from real OS telemetry + DB state. The only
  allowed subprocess is a `--version` probe of node/bun/npm. Interactive work
  goes through real PTYs (`terminal/pty.py`) instead. Don't "fix" the
  executor by spawning shells — that's the vulnerability it exists to avoid.
- **Upstream read timeout is 600s** (`NOVA_UPSTREAM_READ_TIMEOUT`): long
  thinking runs legally sit silent for minutes; a 60s timeout caused
  mid-stream ReadTimeout failures in Claude Code. Tunable via env, default high.
- **Pooled httpx clients** (`UPSTREAM_CLIENT` / `NONSTREAM_CLIENT` in
  `routers/gateway.py`): fresh clients per request pay TCP+TLS per call; the
  pool keeps warm connections. Reuse them; don't instantiate per request.
- **Provider-key cache (30s TTL)** in `gateway.py`: avoids a DB roundtrip per
  upstream attempt. Acceptable staleness by design.
- **Identity spoofing**: the response `model` is always the requested id; the
  real upstream is in `_nova`. Clients (incl. Claude Code) depend on this.
- **Engine sidecar port** never shares the app's HTTP port (Freebuff preview
  proxy points at the single app port; a second listener there makes the proxy
  answer with the sidecar's 404). Default 3099, steps aside on collision
  (`ENGINE_SIDECAR_PORT` in `nova/config.py`).
- **Sandbox preview sets `NOVA_ENGINE_DISABLED=1`** so the preview URL resolves
  to the dashboard, not the sidecar. Production (Docker/Render) unaffected.
- **Additive-only bootstrap**: schema sync creates missing tables; demo-data
  seeds from legacy deployments are cleaned, never created. Reason: deploys must
  never wipe user data (SQLite-in-container is ephemeral; Postgres recommended).
- **Ephemeral-DB warning** is intentional UX (banner + `/health` storage block):
  it tells users to set a Postgres `DATABASE_URL` before their data vanishes.
- **Prisma-style DATABASE_URL normalization** (`file:…`, `postgres://`,
  pgbouncer params, explicit psycopg2/psycopg3 dialect pinning) exists so the
  same connection string works across local/Docker/Render/SQLAlchemy versions.
- **Both `/v1/*` and `/api/v1/*`** mount the same gateway router: OpenAI-SDK
  clients expect `/v1`, some internal tooling uses `/api/v1`. Keep both.
- **Tab registry pattern** (`ui/tabs/__init__.py` loops over modules exporting
  `router`): adding a tab must not require editing `main.py`.

## Keep memory accurate

- When a decision is reversed or a big feature lands, append a dated entry here
  and update `AGENTS.md`/`project-map.md` — that's the whole job of the
  `nova-memory-sync` skill.

## 2026-10-02 — The terminal is one path, and hostable on its own
- **Everything terminal lives under `terminal/`.** `pty.py` (real shells),
  `sandbox.py` (allowlist exec), `link.py` (the seam), `api.py` (the HTTP
  contract), `service.py` (the standalone host), `config.py`, `run.sh`. Reason:
  the interactive terminal hands out root shells, so it has to be sizeable,
  restartable and network-isolable on its own — that is only possible if the
  feature is one directory instead of four spread across `nova/` and `routers/`.
- **The app imports the terminal by path, never the reverse.** `main.py`,
  `routers/admin_terminal.py` and `nova/agent.py` all do `from terminal import
  link` / `from terminal.api import router` / `from terminal.sandbox import …`.
  `terminal/` may use `nova`'s pure config/model/telemetry helpers, never the
  other way round; `terminal/__init__.py` re-exports the seam but deliberately
  not `api` (FastAPI) or `sandbox` (SQLAlchemy), so importing it stays cheap.
- **One contract, two hosts.** `terminal/api.py` is mounted by the gateway
  (`/api/admin/terminal/pty/*`) *and* by the service (`/terminal/pty/*`), so a
  separately hosted terminal can't drift from the local one. `link.py` picks
  `LocalLink` or `RemoteLink` from `NOVA_TERMINAL_URL` alone.
- **Errors carry a stable `code`** (`session_gone`, `session_limit`,
  `link_unavailable`, …) so a remote failure reads the same as a local one.
  `routers/admin_terminal.py` keeps only the dashboard glue (DB history, OS
  telemetry) and mounts the terminal's router at `/pty`.
- **Terminal settings live in `terminal/config.py`, not `nova/config.py`** — a
  host that deploys only `terminal/` still has to read `NOVA_TERMINAL_*`.
- **`terminal/` imports nothing from `nova/`, all the way down.** It reads the
  environment itself, so it is a genuinely separate deployable: `docker build
  ./terminal` produces an image with three dependencies and no database, no
  gateway, no UI. `sandbox.py` is the single exception — it borrows the app for
  command history and `nova …`, so it imports those names optionally and reports
  `APP_AVAILABLE` at every entry point rather than crashing a terminal that has
  no gateway behind it.
- **Agentbox ships inside the terminal, not beside it.** A root prompt without a
  mind behind it is a half-product, and the whole reason people split the
  terminal off is that it has different hardware and a different lifecycle. So
  `/agent/*` (chat, models, and a page showing shells and chat together) is
  mounted by the terminal host only — the gateway already serves `/api/agent/*`,
  and two agents competing for the same routes would be worse than one of them
  being in the right place. Its tools run through the link, so commands land in
  real PTY tabs on whichever host is answering. It is off unless
  `NOVA_AGENTBOX_BASE_URL` is set: no hidden outbound calls, no silent
  "configured" claims.
- **The host serves its own page at `/`.** A terminal deployed on its own once
  answered `{"detail":"Not Found"}` on its homepage: every API route existed
  and no page did, which makes the whole feature useless in a browser.
  `terminal/web/` is that page — session tabs, a real xterm.js shell, Agentbox
  beside it — served by `terminal/service.py` at `/` (and `/agent`, where the
  docs send people). The client keeps a plain append-only fallback because a
  terminal that renders nothing the moment jsdelivr is blocked is not a
  terminal. A hosted terminal therefore needs no dashboard, no gateway and no
  build step to be usable.
- **Providers are a registry, not a single env var.** One endpoint baked in at
  deploy time (`NOVA_AGENTBOX_BASE_URL`, id `env`) is not a config the person
  sitting at the terminal can change, and "which model" is exactly the thing
  they want to switch. So `GET/POST/DELETE /agent/providers` manages a small
  JSON registry (mode `0600`) beside the workspace, the page has a panel for
  it, and each `chat` names a provider. Three rules keep it safe: an API key is
  only ever echoed back masked, an edit with a blank key keeps the stored one,
  and `env` cannot be deleted over the API (unset the variables instead). A
  provider that does not exist is a 404 that lists the ones that do — never a
  silent fall back to the default, which would quietly bill the wrong account.

## 2026-10-02 — The routing brain is ported from OmniRoute
- **The upstream model is OmniRoute's domain layer, not its code.** NovaRouter
  stays Python; `nova/routing.py` re-implements `tagRouter`, `policyEngine`,
  `accountFallback`/`lockoutPolicy`, `fallbackPolicy`, the combo strategies and
  `routerStrategy` as pure functions over plain dicts, and `nova/catalog.py`
  reads a generated JSON snapshot of the OmniRoute provider registry. Reason:
  a Next.js tree-shaking/executor model does not port — but its *decisions* do,
  and the decisions are the valuable part.
- **Decisions live in `nova/`, never in `routers/gateway.py`.** The gateway only
  supplies rows and records outcomes. Everything a routing change touches is a
  pure function with a unit test in `tests/test_routing.py`.
- **The catalogue is data, not code.** `nova/data/provider_registry.json` is a
  generated snapshot (223 providers / 2325 active models) with the retired and
  retiring models already dropped, per OmniRoute's vendor deprecation snapshot.
  Regenerating it is a data step, not a code change.
- **Seeding is additive and providers start disabled.** `bootstrap` inserts only
  rows that are missing and never touches an existing one, so a provider the
  operator already configured keeps its own base URL, prefix and priority, and a
  model they disabled stays disabled. The registry providers ship `enabled=false`
  because they have no key yet; the gateway already skips a provider with no
  enabled key, so seeding cannot cause traffic to move. `NOVA_SEED_REGISTRY=off`
  or `SystemConfig seed_registry_models=off` skips it entirely.
- **One predicate, two chokepoints.** The exposure allow/deny list gates
  `/v1/models` *and* candidate selection, so a hidden model can never re-enter
  through a fallback chain — the exact mistake OmniRoute's `MODEL_EXPOSURE_LIST.md`
  documents.
- **Scopes are opt-in.** `has_scopes()` treats "no scopes declared" as permitted,
  because the console and the agent run in-process with no scope table and
  locking them out would be a regression. A credential that *does* declare scopes
  gets them enforced.
- **The tab lists are paged.** 200+ providers and 2300+ models are the intended
  state, so the Providers and Models tabs render a bounded first page and say
  "N of M"; search narrows to the rest.

## 2026-10-01 — Custom MCP servers are the console's plugin system
- **One table (`McpServer`), two transports.** A plugin is either a streamable
  HTTP MCP endpoint or a local stdio process. Legacy HTTP+SSE (GET stream +
  POST side channel) is deliberately not implemented: every current server
  speaks streamable HTTP, and a half-working second transport is worse than an
  honest two. Reason: plugins must not turn the gateway into a transport zoo.
- **Discovery is cached on the row, never probed at prompt time.** The agent
  prompt is built from the `tools/list` snapshot, so a slow or dead plugin can
  never stall a task — it simply is not offered. "Test"/"Refresh" re-probe on
  demand. Reason: prompt building is on the task's critical path.
- **stdio children are cached (max 8), argv-split, `shell=False`.** A plugin
  boots in ~350 ms; reusing the child keeps repeated agent steps cheap. Nothing
  runs through a shell — `shlex.split` + `create_subprocess_exec` only.
  `mcp_client.close_all()` runs on shutdown, next to `terminal.pty`'s
  `close_all()`.
- **Header values are credentials.** They are stored, masked on every read, and
  a re-save whose value is still masked keeps the stored one — the browser
  never holds the real token, so rotating it means typing a new one.
- **One registry, two consumers.** `nova/mcp_registry.py` backs both the console
  drawer (`/ui/console/plugins*`) and the agent (`mcp_call` action), so what
  the user sees in the UI is exactly what the planner can call.
